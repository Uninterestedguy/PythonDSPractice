## Introduction

Data science is a rapidly growing field that involves extracting insights and knowledge from data. Python has become one of the most popular programming languages for data science due to its simplicity, versatility, and powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

This practice sheet is designed to provide you with hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding of various data science concepts and techniques using Python. It covers topics such as data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## Requirements

To run the exercises in this practice sheet, you need to have the following software installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)

You can install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
